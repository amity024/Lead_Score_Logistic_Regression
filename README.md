# Lead_Score_Case_Study

##Problem Statement:
X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor at around 30%
X Education wants to make lead conversion process more efficient by identifying the most potential leads, also known as Hot Leads
Their sales team want to know these potential set of leads, which they will be focusing more on communicating rather than making calls to everyone. 

##Objective of the Study:
To help  X Education select the most promising leads, i.e., the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. 
The company requires us to build a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads. Such that, the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. 
The CEO has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
